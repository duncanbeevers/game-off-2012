About
=
An experiment in maze-making, and maze-solving. A game about the scope of our vision, about the costs associated with the things we make.

The mind's own point-of-view is both limitless and stifled.

Our vision can be pushed beyond its norm, revealing breath-taking vistas that overshadow our once-all-comprising minutiae.

Larger patterns emerge, and we are asked to exercise our prerogative.
